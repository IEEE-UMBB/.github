IEEE Students Branch Boumerdes is a part of the international organization IEEE which is a community of professionals and engineering students exchanging knowledge and experience.

IEEE is one of the best research platforms in the world, providing many research papers and learning resources in different domains such as electrical engineering. As part of this massive organization, our branch ( located in the institute of electrical and electronic engineering (IGEE ex Inelec)/ Boumerdes- Algeria) carries the same goal: to provide knowledge resources for everyone!

Our activities include mentoring students through a series of workshops in different domains ( PCB design, machine learning, Arduino...), exhibit ideas and projects , empower their voice through our magazine: Eureka and bring the latest technologies through our conferences to home, to them!
